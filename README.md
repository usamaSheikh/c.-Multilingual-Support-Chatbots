How It Works
Frontend: The UI is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). It provides a chat interface where users can type messages and see responses.

Backend: Flask handles the server-side logic, receiving messages and returning appropriate responses.

Translation: The M2M100 model translates between languages in real-time, allowing for multilingual support.

Response System: A keyword-based system matches user input to predefined responses. The response is then translated if necessary.

Customization
Adding New Responses
To add new responses, modify the support_responses dictionary in app.py:

support_responses = {
    "greeting": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
    "your_new_key": "Your new response here",
}
Adding New Languages
To add a new language, add it to the language_codes dictionary in the SimpleMultilingualTranslator class:

self.language_codes = {
    "New Language": "language_code",
}
Also, update the language selector in index.html:

<select id="language">
    <option value="New Language">New Language</option>
</select>
Limitations
The translation model is large and may take time to load initially
Keyword-based response system is simple and may not handle complex queries
No persistent storage for chat history
Future Improvements
Implement more sophisticated natural language processing
Add database support for chat history and user sessions
Optimize translation for better performance
Add user authentication
Implement typing indicators and read receipts
